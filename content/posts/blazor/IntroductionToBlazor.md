Blazor Web Assembly is the new technology announced by Microsoft in Build conference 2020. This has been long time coming. 

## Why?

Dotnet has wide range of application frameworks available. It has Web Pages, ASP.NET MVC, Razor Pages as the main technologies. However other frameworks like Angular, React and Vue JS has become popular in last few years. These frameworks are built to be running on client browser as JavaScript. And they are really fast.

But Microsoft didn't had any framework that can run natively on client browser. Blazor Web assembly is the framework which will run on client browser.

React, Angular and Vue provide a component based programming model. It allows developer to create reusable components. There could be few stateful or stateless components. Dotnet ecosystem didn't had something like this. There is razor pages which can help in creating components but they compiled into html and served by the hosting server. Blazor is truely a component based programming model which doesn't depend on server to produce html. Rather html is produced on the browser with a combination of dotnet assemblies and wasm JavaScript.


## When?

First release was announced on May-2020 which is ready for Production  use.
