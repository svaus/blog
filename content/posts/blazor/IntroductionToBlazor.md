Blazor Web Assembly is the new technology announced by Microsoft in Build conference 2020. This has been long time coming. 

## Why?

Dotnet has wide range of application frameworks available. It has Web Pages, ASP.NET MVC, Razor Pages as the main technologies. However other frameworks like Angular, React and Vue JS has become popular in last few years. These frameworks are built to be running on client browser as JavaScript. And they are really fast.

But Microsoft didn't had any framework that can run natively on client browser. Blazor Web assembly is the framework which will run on client browser.

React, Angular and Vue provide a component based programming model. It allows developer to create reusable components. There could be few stateful or stateless components.
